# 🔐 Z3r0Trust – Trust Me, Always Verified

Z3r0Trust is an autonomous multi-agent security framework powered by Descope to safeguard enterprise systems against modern cyber threats. It continuously authenticates, detects, analyzes, responds, and manages suspicious activities — while ensuring transparency, fairness and SOC oversight.

Unlike traditional SIEMs that only record events, Z3r0Trust combines Descope-based authentication & delegation, real-time log intelligence, autonomous response and human appeal workflows to create a resilient defense ecosystem.

Descope acts as a middleware security layer for third-party applications, protecting them from brute force, credential stuffing, suspicious API usage, and more. Any third-party application integrating with Z3r0Trust creates a proxy URL that routes backend traffic through Z3r0Trust middleware. This ensures logs are captured, anomalies are detected, and malicious actors are blocked automatically.

## 🎯 Hackathon Theme / Challenge Addressed

**Theme 3:** Secure agent-to-agent communication with Descope
**Theme:** Design How Agents Talk, Trust, and Team Up
**Level:** Advanced

**Challenges:**

* Build a secure, multi-agent system where autonomous agents communicate across trust boundaries.
* Include at least two agents with distinct scopes/roles.
* Use **Descope** as the identity and access management layer for all agent communication.
* Enforce **OAuth-based scoped access and delegated trust**.
* Capture and replay **user consent** if agents operate on behalf of users.
* Secure exposed APIs via **Descope Inbound Apps**.

---

## 📌 Problem

Enterprises face persistent challenges:

* *Credential theft and phishing* are leading attack vectors.
* *SOC teams are overwhelmed* by noisy or repetitive alerts.
* *Slow response times* due to manual triage.
* *Legitimate users often get blocked* unfairly without recourse.

**Logs alone are not enough.**
Z3r0Trust transforms raw events into *actionable security outcomes* with *autonomous containment and fair user handling*.

---

## 🏗 Solution

Z3r0Trust introduces a *coordinated system of specialized agents*, each with a clear responsibility. All inter-agent communication is secured via **Descope OAuth tokens** with scoped access, ensuring strict trust boundaries.

**Third-party integration flow:**

* The 3rd-party app integrates with Z3r0Trust by creating a **proxy URL** inside Z3r0Trust.
* All traffic flows through this middleware, where **Descope** authenticates and validates user attributes.
* Logs are captured, anomalies detected, and malicious users are automatically blocked while legitimate access continues.

### Guidelines Alignment

* ✅ Z3r0Trust's agents with clearly defined roles interact using the access tokens generated by **Descope**, ensuring secure and trusted communication.
* ✅ Descope used for all token generation, validation, and delegation.
* ✅ Scope restrictions enforced on all protected endpoints.
* ✅ Delegation demonstrated when one agent acts on behalf of another (e.g., Mail Agent handling alerts).
* ✅ Descope Flows applied for user-facing consent (e.g., MFA, appeal approvals).

## 🤖 Agents

### 🔍 Detector Agent

* Authenticates with **Descope**.
* Retrieves user attributes (IP, device, geo, MFA status).
* Validates logins and flags anomalies.
* Forwards enriched logs to **Splunk**.

### 📊 Analyser Agent

* Receives logs from Detector Agent.
* Sends data to **Splunk** for real-time processing.
* Splunk processes in 3 tiers:
  * **High Frequency (5 mins):** Brute force, credential stuffing, suspicious API usage, bot/malware.
  * **Medium Frequency (30 mins):** Impossible travel, account takeover, privilege escalation.
  * **Low Frequency (5 hrs):** Data exfiltration, insider abuse, network anomalies.
* Maintains **MD5 hash cache** (alert\_name.username.ip.device) to prevent duplicate alerts.
* Forwards validated anomalies to Alert Handler Agent.

### 🚨 Alert Handler Agent

* Processes alert data.
* Decides on appropriate action:
  * Temporary/Permanent block
  * User logout or session invalidation
  * Enforce MFA
* Coordinates with Mail Sender, Database Controller, and Appeal Handler.
* Creates **appeal tickets** in DB.

### 📧 Mail Sender Agent

* Handles outbound email notifications.
* Pre-configured with secure sender ID and app passkey.
* Use cases:
  * Alert user of suspicious activity.
  * Notify SOC with forensic details.
  * Confirm appeal submission.
  * Notify user of account reinstatement.

### 🗄 Database Controller Agent

* Securely interfaces with the database under scoped privileges.
* Only executes *traceable and recoverable* operations.
* Acts as a delegate to SOC for safe query execution.

### 📝 Appeal Handler Agent

* Activated when a user submits an appeal.
* Reviews alert data + user message.
* If low risk, reinstates account autonomously.
* If uncertain, escalates to **SOC Analyst**.
* Updates DB and notifies user via Mail Sender.

➡️ The last four agents (Alert Handler, Mail Sender, Database Controller, and Appeal Handler) communicate among themselves using secure access keys. If any third-party tries to access them without proper authorization, they are blocked instantly based on **Descope access key authentication**.

---

## 📂 Example Work Flow (Scenario Based)

**Scenario:** Multiple failed logins → sudden success from a new device in Moscow.

1. **Detector** authenticates login via **Descope OAuth**, retrieves attributes, and sends enriched logs to Splunk.
2. **Analyser** correlates with Splunk, scores risk as High.
3. **Alert Handler** suspends account, updates Alerts DB.
4. **Mail MCP Agent** sends:

   * ✉ User-friendly alert to employee
   * 📑 SOC email with forensic details
5. **SOC Analyst** validates the suspension.
6. **Appeal Agent** reviews employee’s appeal, reinstates if legitimate.

➡ Threat contained instantly  
➡ SOC informed with summarized context  
➡ User treated fairly with transparent process  
➡ Full **Descope-based trust validation** ensured

```
cd ../Bank
npm install
npm run dev
```
    Login Credentials (Bank Management App)
      Login Id: diva22022.it@rmkec.ac.in
      Password: 123qwe!@#QWE
