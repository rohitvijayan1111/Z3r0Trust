## 📌 Problem

Despite advanced firewalls and monitoring, Enterprise organizations continue to face:

- 🔑 **Credential theft and phishing** remain top attack vectors.  
- 🛡️ **SOC teams are overwhelmed** by repetitive or noisy alerts.  
- ⏳ **Response times lag** because incidents require manual triage.  
- 🚫 **Legitimate users are unfairly blocked**, often without recourse.  

**Logs alone are not enough.**  
Z3r0Trust transforms raw events into **actionable security outcomes** with autonomous containment and **fair user handling**.
